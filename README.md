# todowebapp
A Java based web app for ToDo activities.

## Technologies Used
Java  
Servlet, JSP  
Tomcat  
MySQL  
HTML  

This is entirely a back-end project. So, front-end technologies like CSS, JavaScript are not used. The aim of the project is to effectively learn and showcase how different pieces of the Java Servlet API work together.

We shall develop the web application starting with requirements analysis. Then we shall move on to database design. Data is central to any web application. Almost all use cases deal with data. Once the web application's data model is ready, we shall then move on to design the architecture of the application. In this phase, we shall see how our application behaves to different HTTP actions. Because, all actions performed by the application's users are through HTTP. We shall think of all possible user actions and define them clearly. Next, we shall move on to designing the interfaces and classes.
